## Overview
The **Spotify Artist Lookup Plugin** allows Obsidian users to fetch artist data from Spotify and automatically create a structured note with relevant metadata, including genres, Spotify links, and images. 

## Features
- 🔍 **Search for any artist** from the command palette.
- 📄 **Creates a structured note** with:
  - Genres (listed properly in YAML frontmatter)
  - Spotify, Chosic, and EveryNoise profile links
  - Artist image
- 📂 **Custom save location**: Users can specify a folder where artist notes should be saved.

   ```plaintext
   <your-obsidian-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/
   ```
3. Restart Obsidian.
4. Go to **Settings → Community Plugins** and enable "Spotify Artist Lookup."

## Handling Duplicate Files
- **Currently, if a note with the same name already exists, the plugin will fail to create a new file.**
- **Merging data into existing files is not yet implemented** (see roadmap).

## Roadmap / Future Enhancements
- [ ] Implement merging metadata into existing notes instead of creating duplicates.
- [ ] Implement logic to append a number to duplicate filenames instead of failing.
- [ ] Add more customization for metadata fields.
- [ ] Support fetching **discographies**.
- [ ] Option to choose image size.
- [ ] Auto-fetch latest top tracks.
