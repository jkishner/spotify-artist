## Handling Duplicate Files
- **Currently, if a note with the same name already exists, the plugin will fail to create a new file.**
- **Merging data into existing files is not yet implemented** (see roadmap).

## Roadmap / Future Enhancements
- [ ] Implement merging metadata into existing notes instead of creating duplicates.
- [ ] Implement logic to append a number to duplicate filenames instead of failing.
- [ ] Add more customization for metadata fields.
- [ ] Support fetching **discographies**.
- [ ] Option to choose image size.
- [ ] Auto-fetch latest top tracks.
